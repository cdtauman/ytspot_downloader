"""utils/playwright_check.py — single-source Playwright availability check.

Playwright is an optional runtime dependency. It powers:
  * core/scraper.py             — channel + artist discography scraping
  * core/cookie_wizard.py       — sign-in / cookie-grab browser
  * core/universal_extractor.py — generic-site stream interception
  * core/channel_tab_discoverer.py
  * core/listing_scraper.py

The Windows EXE does NOT bundle the Chromium browser (~300 MB).
Instead, the user runs ``scripts/install_playwright.ps1`` once after
install. Anything that needs Playwright must call
``require_playwright_or_raise(feature_name)`` before doing work, or
check ``is_playwright_available()`` and degrade gracefully.

Zero GUI imports.
