.SYNOPSIS
    Install Playwright Chromium so YTSpot's optional features work.

.DESCRIPTION
    Run this once on a fresh install. Playwright downloads ~300 MB of
    browser binaries to %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\.

    Features that need Playwright:
      * Channel and artist discography scraping (core/scraper.py)
      * Cookie sign-in wizard (core/cookie_wizard.py)
      * Universal stream extractor (core/universal_extractor.py)

    Plain YouTube / YT Music / Spotify single-track and playlist
    downloads do NOT require Playwright. The app degrades gracefully
    and the preflight check announces the missing component.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh scripts\install_playwright.ps1
    From the repo root, with python on PATH.

.EXAMPLE
    & 'C:\Program Files\YTSpot Downloader\scripts\install_playwright.ps1'
    From an installed copy. Uses the bundled Python if present.
