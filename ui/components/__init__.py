=========================
Reusable leaf-level widgets for YTSpot Downloader.

Each component is a self-contained QWidget subclass that owns its own
layout, signals, and styling.  Panels import from here; nothing in this
package imports from ui/panels/ (strict one-way dependency).

Components
----------
TrackCard          – Draggable queue entry with thumbnail, progress, status.
SearchResultCard   – Compact search result with "Add to Queue" action.
HistoryRow         – One row in the download-history table.
UpdateBanner       – Slide-in notification banner for app updates.
